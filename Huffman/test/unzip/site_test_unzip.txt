 Thread starter1still_waters  Start dateAug 14, 2011
Christian Chat is a moderated online Christian community allowing Christians around the world to fellowship with each other in real time chat via webcam, voice, and text, with the Christian Chat app. You can also start or participate in a Bible-based discussion here in the Christian Chat Forums, where members can also share with each other their own videos, pictures, or favorite Christian music.

If you are a Christian and need encouragement and fellowship, we're here for you! If you are not a Christian but interested in knowing more about Jesus our Lord, you're also welcome! Want to know what the Bible says, and how you can apply it to your life? Join us!

The purpose of this thread is to post long dense chunks of text which will cause the reader to tune you out and scroll to the next entry. Which is the genius of this thread. The next entry will be just another long dense chunk of copy and pasted text.

Wikipedia on Jamie Moyer


Jamie Moyer (born November 17, 1962) is an American professional left handed baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. At the time of his last game to date (in June 2010), he was the oldest player in the major leagues and had the most wins, losses, and strikeouts of any active Major League pitcher. He has been likened to Phil Niekro.[1][2][3]
Moyer has pitched for the Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies. He made the All-Star team in 2003, while with the Mariners. Moyer has won numerous awards for philanthropy and community service, including the 2003 Roberto Clemente Award, the 2003 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, the 2003 Hutch Award and the 2004 Branch Rickey Award. Moyer is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.

Amateur career

High school
Moyer attended Souderton Area High School in Souderton, Pennsylvania, where he played baseball, basketball, and golf.
College
Moyer pitched at Saint Joseph's University where in 1984 he set the school's single-season records in wins, with 16, ERA, with 1.99, and strikeouts, with 90.[4] In 1997 he became the only Saint Joseph's baseball player to have his jersey number, number 10, retired,[4] and was one of three inductees into the first class of the St. Joseph's Baseball Hall of Fame.
He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the sixth round of the 1984 amateur draft, and completed his college degree from Indiana University in 1996.
Professional career

1986–1996
Moyer was selected a New York – Penn League All-Star in 1984. He made his major league debut with the Chicago Cubs on June 16, 1986, against Steve Carlton and the Philadelphia Phillies, and got his first win. Later that year, on August 16, he threw his first shutout against the Montreal Expos. He was also the starting pitcher for the Cubs on the day that Greg Maddux made his major league debut.
In 1987, Moyer ranked tenth in the National League in strikeouts with 147, while winning 12 games. Following his then-best season in 1988, he was traded to the Texas Rangers as part of the 9-player Rafael Palmeiro for Mitch Williams trade.[2]
Moyer was on the disabled list with a sore left shoulder for much of a disappointing 1989 season. 1990 saw Moyer spend time in the bullpen before regaining a spot in the starting rotation.
Moyer was released as a free agent after the 1990 season and was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals. He made seven starts for the Cardinals in 1991 before being sent to the minor leagues on May 24, and was released on October 14.
In 1992, Moyer went to spring training with the Chicago Cubs, but was released and spent the rest of the season in the minor league system of the Detroit Tigers. On December 18, 1992, Moyer signed with the Baltimore Orioles.
Moyer began the 1993 campaign in the Oriole minor leagues, before being called up on May 30. He tied his career-high total in wins with 12 and a new career-low ERA of 3.43. The strike-shortened 1994 season was disappointing for him, but he was third on the staff in innings pitched. In 1995, Moyer again found himself in the Baltimore bullpen, but worked his way back into the starting rotation. He was released following the 1995 campaign, but his contract was picked up by the Boston Red Sox on December 22. Moyer started the 1996 season in the Boston bullpen, but made seven starts for the Red Sox by year's end.
Seattle Mariners
1996–1998


Moyer was the Mariner franchise's all-time leader in starts, wins and IP. He went 145-87 with an ERA of 3.97 over eleven seasons with the M's.
In the middle of the 1996 season, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners on July 30, where he would start 11 games and go 6–2. His record of 13–3 would lead the majors in winning percentage at .813.
In 1997, Moyer was fifth in the American League with 17 wins. His 17–5 record gave him the second highest winning percentage (.773) in the league. Moyer would make his first postseason start against his former club Baltimore, but was forced out with a strained elbow in the fifth inning.
In 1998, Moyer went 15–9 with a 3.53 ERA. He was third in innings pitched with 234.1. He registered his 100th career win against the Cleveland Indians on August 27, as well as his 1000th career strikeout with a sixth inning strikeout of David Bell. He was named Seattle's Pitcher of the Year by the Seattle chapter of the BBWAA.
1999–2000
He walked two or fewer batters in 29 of his 32 starts. He ranked fourth in the American League averaging just 1.9 walks per nine innings. Moyer was also third among the league in innings pitched and seventh winning percentage. He matched career-best seven game winning streak that stretched from May 11 to July 7. He started the Inaugural Game at Safeco Field on July 15 against the San Diego Padres, throwing a called strike to San Diego's Quilvio Veras for the first pitch getting a no-decision in Seattle's 3–2 loss after leaving with a 2–1 lead after eight innings.[5] He defeated Baltimore for the ninth straight time on July 31; did not lose to the Orioles, in the 1990s. Moyer's only loss at Safeco came on August 5 against the New York Yankees. He recorded three complete games in the final month of the season, tossing back-to-back complete games on September 14 and 19. His 2.30 ERA after the All-Star break was the second-lowest among AL starters, behind only Pedro Martinez with his 2.01 ERA. He pitched 4 complete games for the second-straight season, tying his career best.
In 1999, Moyer went 14–8 with a 3.87 ERA and was voted to The Sporting News AL All-Star team. He again won the Seattle Pitcher of the Year award.
2000 saw Moyer rebound from an early shoulder injury to tally 13 wins, giving him at least 13 in each of his past five seasons. He made his first Opening Day start for Seattle, but lost to the Boston Red Sox 2–0 on April 4. His shoulder problems led his ERA to balloon to 5.49. A knee injury[6] suffered on the last pitch of a simulated game caused him to miss Seattle's trip to the American League Championship Series against the eventual World Series champion New York Yankees.
Moyer lost five consecutive starts from August 4-24. He allowed a career-high and a club-record 11 earned runs in a 19–3 loss on August 9 against the Chicago White Sox. He allowed 11 runs, 6 earned, in a 14–4 loss on August 14 against the Detroit Tigers, joining the Houston Astros' Jose Lima as the first two pitchers since 1950 to allow ten or more runs in consecutive starts. Moyer allowed a career-high seven walks in a no-decision on August 29 against the Yankees. The Mariners' 7–2 win on September 9 against the Minnesota Twins snapped a six-game losing streak. Moyer lasted just one-and-two-thirds innings in his final start, getting a no-decision September 28 against the Texas Rangers. Moyer suffered a hairline fracture of left kneecap while pitching a simulated game on October 7.
2001–2003
In 2001 Moyer won 20 games, ranked tied for second in the American League, and his 3.43 ERA was sixth in the AL. He earned his 150th career win against the Texas Rangers on September 24. He became only the second Mariner in history to win 20 games on October 5, former teammate Randy Johnson being the other. Moyer went 3–0 with a 1.89 ERA in the postseason. He won Games 2 and 5 for the Mariners against the Cleveland Indians and also carried Game 3 against the New York Yankees before Seattle lost in Game 5.
In 2002, Moyer went 13–8 with a then career low 3.32 ERA. Although he pitched 20 more innings and had a lower ERA than in 2001, he won seven fewer games.
Moyer was fourth in the AL in innings with 230.2. He was tied for second in the league with 34 starts, fifth in opponents' batting average, holding opposing hitters to a .230 clip, and ninth in ERA with 3.32. He tossed a team-high 24 consecutive scoreless innings from June 16 to July 6. He averaged just two walks per nine innings pitched, tied for sixth-best in the AL. The Mariners were 20–14 in his starts. His four complete games tied his career high, also done in 1998 and 1999. He threw his seventh career complete game shutout, first of the season, on June 10 against the St. Louis Cardinals in a 10–0 win. Moyer's start on June 16 against San Diego began a streak of 24 consecutive shutout innings over four starts. He finished June 3–1 with a Major League best 1.01 ERA in five starts. He collected his 1,500th career strikeout August 24 against the Cleveland Indians.
In 2003, Moyer won a career high 21 games, lost 7, and had a career low 3.27 ERA. He tied for second in the American League for wins and was sixth in ERA. His .750 winning percentage placed him fourth in the league and his 21 wins are a club record. He became the only Seattle pitcher to win 20 games more than once. Moyer was voted to his first All-Star Game in 2003. He was named for the third time the Seattle Pitcher of the Year. Moyer was also the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to the big leaguer whose success on the field is mirrored by his impact in community service, The Hutch Award, presented annually by the world-renowned Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to an MLB player displaying "honor, courage and dedication to baseball, both on and off the field," and The Lou Gehrig Award, presented annually to the MLB player who both on and off the field best exemplifies the character of Lou Gehrig.
2004–2005
In 2004, Moyer went 7–13 and posted his first losing record since 1994. While the year started well for him, going 5–0 with a 1.59 ERA from May 20 – June 18, Moyer ended 2004 on a 10-game losing streak. He threw the slowest fastball of all AL starters, averaging 81.6 mph.[7] One positive for Moyer was he was awarded the Branch Rickey Award for his exceptional community service following the season.
During the 2005 season Moyer passed Randy Johnson to become the winningest pitcher for the Mariners on May 30. On July 8, 2005, Moyer became the 25th southpaw to win 200 games in Major League Baseball. He finished with a 13–7 record and for the second year in a row he threw the slowest fastball of all major league starters, averaging 81.7 mph.[8]
On June 18, 2006, he became the 33rd man to start 500 major league games. In his 11 seasons with the Mariners, Moyer had a record of 145–87 with a 3.97 ERA in 324 games (323 starts) and is the franchise leader in wins, starts and innings pitched.
Moyer is also one of the all-time leaders in 1–0 complete game losses. Moyer has lost eight games having surrendered only one run over nine innings. Before being traded in August of 2006, he was the oldest active American League player.
Philadelphia Phillies
2006


Philanthropic Phillie: Moyer Foundation serves children under distress in Philadelphia and Seattle.
On August 19, 2006, Moyer was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor league pitchers Andrew Barb and Andrew Baldwin. In his first start with the Phillies, Moyer set a franchise record as the oldest pitcher to record a win. In eight starts with the Phillies in 2006, Moyer went 5–2 with a 4.03 ERA. After the season, Moyer signed a two-year extension worth $10.5 million with the Phillies on October 23.[9]
2007
On April 13, 2007, at age 44 Moyer combined with Tom Glavine to become the oldest matchup of lefty starters (85 years, 163 days) in major league history. He struck out six batters in the game which included his 2000th batter. Later that month, on April 29 Moyer pitched a two-hitter through 71&#8260;3 innings as he recorded a win against the Florida Marlins. On May 9, at age 44, Moyer broke that same record when he combined with Randy Johnson to become the oldest match up of lefty starters (88 years, 48 days) in major league history. Moyer won the game, with Johnson receiving a no decision.
In the finale to the 2007 season, Tom Glavine and Moyer faced off respectively in separate games to determine the National League Eastern Division Champions, as the division lead was tied at 88 wins. Moyer defeated the Washington Nationals, pitching 51&#8260;3 innings and surrendering no runs, and three hits, while Glavine was crushed by the Marlins at Shea Stadium, surrendering seven runs in the first inning, hitting a batter with the bases loaded and recording only a single out before being pulled.[10]
He threw the slowest fastball of all NL starters in 2007, averaging 81.1 miles per hour (130.5 km/h).[11]
2008
In 2008, at age 45, Moyer became the oldest active player in Major League baseball. On April 30, Moyer hit a single off Padres pitcher Chris Young into left center field to become the oldest Phillie ever to get a hit.[12][13]
On May 26, Moyer won his 235th career game, giving him at least one victory over each Major League team. The victory came in a 20–5 win over the Colorado Rockies. Moyer pitched seven innings, struck out seven batters, and gave up four runs. He followed that in his next start against the Florida Marlins by earning his sixth victory of the season, pitching seven innings and giving up five runs.
On September 11, Moyer won his 14th game of the season against the Milwaukee Brewers, which began the Phillies a seven-game win streak. On September 27, Moyer took the mound for the Phillies against the Nationals, in a game where the Phillies could clinch the National League East title with a win. Moyer pitched six innings and gave up only one run and the Phillies won the game 4–3. Moyer earned his 16th win of the year, the second oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat, finishing with a 3.71 ERA. He also threw the slowest fastball of all NL starters in 2008, averaging 81.2 miles per hour.[14] He threw cutters 29.5% of the time, the highest rate in the NL.[14]
On October 4 against the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2008 National League Division Series, Moyer became the second oldest pitcher to ever start a post-season game at the age of 45 years 321 days, and the oldest since 1929 when Jack Quinn started for the Philadelphia Athletics at 46 years 103 days.
On October 12, Moyer became the oldest pitcher at 45 years 329 days to pitch in a National League Championship Series game, starting in Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. However, he struggled during the game and surrendered six runs in 11&#8260;3 innings—his shortest start in over eight years—and went on to lose the game.
On October 25, Moyer made his first World Series start against the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching 61&#8260;3 innings, giving up three runs, and receiving a no-decision. More impressive was that he pitched with a severe stomach virus.[15] He won his first World Series ring when the Phillies defeated the Rays on October 29, winning his first ring in his 23rd Major League Season. In his speech at the World Series celebration at Citizens Bank Park on October 31, he related to the fans that he grew up as a Phillies fan and played hooky from Souderton Area High School to attend the Phillies' championship parade in 1980. On December 15, 2008 Moyer signed a two year, $16 million contract with the Phillies, keeping him with the club through the conclusion of the 2010 season.[16]
2009
Moyer posted a 3–5 record with a 7.42 ERA,[17] but earned his 250th career win on May 31 against the Washington Nationals in a 4–2 win, becoming the 44th pitcher and the 11th lefty to do this.[18] By the All-Star break, Moyer had improved his record to 8–6 and had lowered his ERA to 5.99. On July 16, Moyer won his 255th career game, pitching a one-hitter through seven scoreless innings and passing Jack Morris for 41st on the all-time wins list. Despite leading the rotation with ten wins, Moyer sported a 5.47 ERA when the Phillies decided to move him to the bullpen, making room in their rotation for Pedro Martínez.[19] Regarding the move, manager Charlie Manuel said,
"Jamie was a total professional and team player when we let him know of the decision to move him to the bullpen. He has been, and will continue to be, a very important part of this team."[19]
In Moyer's bullpen debut on August 18, he relieved Martínez in the fourth inning after a rain delay, pitching six scoreless innings to earn his 11th win of the season. A similar situation occurred on August 28, as Moyer again relieved Martinez in the third inning after a rain delay. He pitched four and one third innings in relief, giving up one earned run and picked up his 12th win of the season.
Moyer tore three muscles in his groin and lower abdomen while pitching against the Houston Astros on September 29. He missed the rest of the regular season, and was not on the Phillies' postseason roster.[20]
2010–2011
When asked about retiring after the expiration of his Phillies contract at the end of 2010, Moyer said, "You know, I'm going to leave that as an open-ended question because I don't know how to answer that. It could be (my last season). It potentially could be. But so could have last year. So could have two years ago, so could have five years ago."[21]
After the retirement of Ken Griffey Jr. in early 2010, Moyer, along with Omar Vizquel, were the last two active players in MLB who played in the 1980s. On April 10, at age 47, Moyer became the sixth oldest pitcher to appear in a game and the eighth major league pitcher to start a game in four different decades. Moyer pitched six innings and earned his 259th career victory.[22] On May 7, Moyer became the oldest player in Major League Baseball history (47 years, 170 days) to pitch a shutout, blanking the Braves on two hits, striking out five batters and walking none.[23] Moyer also became the only MLB pitcher to throw a shutout in four different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).
On June 5, Moyer became the third MLB pitcher to win 100 games after turning 40 years old, defeating the San Diego Padres, 6–2, using just 98 pitches to accomplish the feat. It was also his second complete game of the season. On June 16, Moyer became the oldest pitcher to ever defeat the New York Yankees. Moyer beat the Yankees at 47 years, 210 days. The previous oldest pitcher to beat them was Phil Niekro at 47 years, 122 days, according to the Griffin Sports Bureau. On June 27, he became the all-time major league leader in home runs allowed (506), passing Robin Roberts. On July 20, Moyer left a start against the St. Louis Cardinals due to an elbow strain after pitching only one inning.[24] The injury proved to be a sprain in his ulnar collateral ligament and a strain of his flexor pronator, which resulted in Moyer missing the remainder of the 2010 season.[25]

Why is the sky blue?



On a clear sunny day, the sky above us looks bright blue. In the evening, the sunset puts on a brilliant show of reds, pinks and oranges. Why is the sky blue? What makes the sunset red? 
To answer these questions, we must learn about light, and the Earth's atmosphere. 

THE ATMOSPHERE


The atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans. 
The composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot. 
The atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space. 

LIGHT WAVES


Light is a kind of energy that radiates, or travels, in waves. Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. For example, sound is a wave of vibrating air. Light is a wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. It is one small part of a larger range of vibrating electromagnetic fields. This range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Electromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec (186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light. 

 


The energy of the radiation depends on its wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance between the tops (crests) of the waves. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by each second. The longer the wavelength of the light, the lower the frequency, and the less energy it contains. 

COLORS OF LIGHT


Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky. 

 


The colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. That means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, and lowest frequency and energy. 

LIGHT IN THE AIR


Light travels through space in a straight line as long as nothing disturbs it. As light moves through the atmosphere, it continues to go straight until it bumps into a bit of dust or a gas molecule. Then what happens to the light depends on its wave length and the size of the thing it hits. 
Dust particles and water droplets are much larger than the wavelength of visible light. When light hits these large particles, it gets reflected, or bounced off, in different directions. The different colors of light are all reflected by the particle in the same way. The reflected light appears white because it still contains all of the same colors. 
Gas molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If light bumps into them, it acts differently. When light hits a gas molecule, some of it may get absorbed. After awhile, the molecule radiates (releases, or gives off) the light in a different direction. The color that is radiated is the same color that was absorbed. The different colors of light are affected differently. All of the colors can be absorbed. But the higher frequencies (blues) are absorbed more often than the lower frequencies (reds). This process is called Rayleigh scattering. (It is named after Lord John Rayleigh, an English physicist, who first described it in the 1870's.) 

WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?


The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. 
However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. 

 


As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white. 

 



THE BLACK SKY AND WHITE SUN


On Earth, the sun appears yellow. If you were out in space, or on the moon, the sun would look white. In space, there is no atmosphere to scatter the sun's light. On Earth, some of the shorter wavelength light (the blues and violets) are removed from the direct rays of the sun by scattering. The remaining colors together appear yellow. 
Also, out in space, the sky looks dark and black, instead of blue. This is because there is no atmosphere. There is no scattered light to reach your eyes. 

 



WHY IS THE SUNSET RED?


As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes. 

 


The sky around the setting sun may take on many colors. The most spectacular shows occur when the air contains many small particles of dust or water. These particles reflect light in all directions. Then, as some of the light heads towards you, different amounts of the shorter wavelength colors are scattered out. You see the longer wavelengths, and the sky appears red, pink or orange. 




LEARN MORE ABOUT:THE ATMOSPHERE


WHAT IS THE ATMOSPHERE?


The atmosphere is the mixture of gases and other materials that surround the Earth in a thin, mostly transparent shell. It is held in place by the Earth's gravity. The main components are nitrogen (78.09%), oxygen (20.95%), argon (0.93%), and carbon dioxide (0.03%). The atmosphere also contains small amounts, or traces, of water (in local concentrations ranging from 0% to 4%), solid particles, neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, xenon and ozone. The study of the atmosphere is called meteorology. 
Life on Earth would not be possible without the atmosphere. Obviously, it provides the oxygen we need to breath. But it also serves other important functions. It moderates the planet's temperature, reducing the extremes that occur on airless worlds. For example, temperatures on the moon range from 120 °C (about 250 °F) in the day to -170 °C (about -275 °F) at night. The atmosphere also protects us by absorbing and scattering harmful radiation from the sun and space. 
Of the total amount of the sun's energy that reaches the Earth, 30% is reflected back into space by clouds and the Earth's surface. The atmosphere absorbs 19%. Only 51% is absorbed by the Earth's surface. 
We are not normally aware of it but air does have weight. The column of air above us exerts pressure on us. This pressure at sea level is defined as one atmosphere. Other equivalent measurements you may hear used are 1,013 millibars, 760 mm Hg (mercury), 29.92 inches of Hg, or 14.7 pounds/square inch (psi). Atmospheric pressure decreases rapidly with height. Pressure drops by a factor of 10 for every 16 km (10 miles) increase in altitude. This means that the pressure is 1 atmosphere at sea level, but 0.1 atmosphere at 16 km and only 0.01 atmosphere at 32 km. 
The density of the lower atmosphere is about 1 kg/cubic meter (1 oz./cubic foot). There are approximately 300 billion billion (3 x 10**20, or a 3 followed by 20 zeros) molecules per cubic inch (16.4 cubic centimeters). At ground level, each molecule is moving at about 1600 km/hr (1000 miles/hr), and collides with other molecules 5 billion times per second. 
The density of air also decreases rapidly with altitude. At 3 km (2 miles) air density has decreased by 30%. People who normally live closer to sea level experience temporary breathing difficulties when traveling to these altitudes. The highest permanent human settlements are at about 4 km (3 miles). 

LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE


The atmosphere is divided into layers based on temperature, composition and electrical properties. These layers are approximate and the boundaries vary, depending on the seasons and latitude. (The boundaries also depend on which "authority" is defining them.) 
LAYERS BASED ON COMPOSITION



Homosphere 
· The lowest 100 km (60 miles), including the Troposphere, Stratosphere and Mesosphere. 
· Contains 99% of the atmosphere's mass. 
· Molecules do not stratify by molecular weight. 
· Although small local variations exist, it has a relatively uniform composition, due to continuous mixing, turbulence and eddy diffusion. 
· Water is one of two components that is not equally distributed. As water vapor rises, it cools and condenses, returning to earth as rain and snow. The Stratosphere is extremely dry. 
· Ozone is another molecule not equally distributed. (Read about the ozone layer in the Stratosphere section below.) 

Heterosphere 
· Extends above homosphere, including the Thermosphere and Exosphere. 
·Stratified (components are separated in layers) based on molecular weight. The heavier molecules, like nitrogen and oxygen, are concentrated in the lowest levels. The lighter ones, helium and hydrogen, predominate higher up. 

LAYERS BASED ON ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES



Neutral atmosphere 
· Below about 100 km (60 miles) 

Ionosphere 
· Above about 100 km 
· Contains electrically charged particles or ions, created by the absorption of UV (ultraviolet) light. 
· The degree of ionization varies with altitude. 
· Different layers reflect long and short radio waves. This allows radio signals to be sent around the curved surface of the earth. 
· The Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis (the Northern and Southern Lights) occur in this layer. 
· The Magnetosphere is the upper part of the ionosphere, extending out to 64,000 km (40,000 miles.) It protects us from the high energy, electrically charged particles of the solar wind, which are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. 



 


LAYERS BASED ON TEMPERATURE


Troposphere - Height depends on the seasons and latitude. It extends from ground level up to about 16 km (10 miles) at the equator, and to 9 km (5 miles) at the North and South Poles. 
· The prefix "tropo" means change. Changing conditions in the Troposphere result in our weather. 
· Temperature decreases with increasing altitude. Warm air rises, then cools and falls back to Earth. This process is called convection, and results in huge movements of air. Winds in this layer are mostly vertical. 
· Contains more air molecules than all the other layers combined. 

Stratosphere - Extends out to about 50 km (30 miles) 
· The air is very thin. 
· The prefix "strato" is related to layers, or stratification. 
· The bottom of this layer is calm. Jet planes often fly in the lower Stratosphere to avoid bad weather in the Troposphere. 
· The upper part of the Stratosphere holds the high winds known as the jet streams. These blow horizontally at speeds up to 480 km/hour (300 miles/hour) 
· Contains the "ozone layer" located between 15 - 40 km ( 10 - 25 miles) above the surface. Although the concentration of ozone is at most 12 parts per million (ppm), it is very effective at absorbing the harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun and protecting life on Earth. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. The oxygen molecule we need to breathe contains two oxygen atoms. 
· The temperature is cold, about -55 °C (-67 °F) in the lower part, and increases with increasing altitude. The increase is caused by the absorption of UV radiation by the oxygen and ozone. 
· The temperature increase with altitude results in a layering effect. It creates a global "inversion layer", and reduces vertical convection. 

Mesosphere - Extends out to about 100 km (65 miles) 
· Temperature decreases rapidly with increasing altitude. 

Thermosphere - Extends out to about 400 km ( 250 miles) 
· Temperature increases rapidly with increasing altitude, due to absorption of extremely short wavelength UV radiation. 
· Meteors, or "shooting stars," start to burn up around 110-130 km (70-80 miles) above the earth. 

Exosphere -Extends beyond the Thermosphere hundreds of kilometers, gradually fading into interstellar space. 
· Density of the air is so low that the normal concept of temperature loses its meaning. 
· Molecules often escape into space after colliding with one another.

Why is the sky blue?



Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space. Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white, but it is really a mixture of many colors. The colors in white light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky. 

 

The sky is filled with air. Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff, like dust. 
As sunlight goes through the air, it bumps into the molecules and dust. When light hits a gas molecule, it may bounce off in a different direction. Some colors of light, like red and orange, pass straight through the air. But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions. In this way, the blue light gets scattered all around the sky. 
When you look up, some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky. Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. 

 

In space, there is no air. Because there is nothing for the light to bounce off, it just goes straight. None of the light gets scattered, and the "sky" looks dark and black.




 








<A name=PROJECTS>PROJECTS TO DO TOGETHER





SAFETY NOTE: Please read all instructions completely before starting. Observe all safety precautions. 

PROJECT 1 - Split light into a spectrum

What you need: 
a small mirror, a piece of white paper or cardboard, water a large shallow bowl, pan, or plastic shoebox a window with direct sunlight coming in, or a sunny day outdoor What to do: 
Fill the bowl or pan about 2/3 full of water. Place it on a table or the floor, directly in the sunlight. (Note: the direct sunlight is important for this experiment to work right.)
Hold the mirror under water, facing towards the sun. Hold the paper above and in front of the mirror. Adjust the positions of the paper and mirror until the reflected light shines on the paper. Observe the colored spectrum.


 
What happened: The water and mirror acted like a prism, splitting the light into the colors of the spectrum. (When light passes from one medium to another, for example from air to water, its speed and direction change. [This is called refraction, and will be discussed in a future issue.] The different colors of light are affected differently. Violet light slows the most, and bends the most. Red light slows and bends the least. The different colors of light are spread out and separated, and we can see the spectrum.) 



PROJECT 2 - Sky in a jar

What you need: 
a clear, straight-sided drinking glass, or clear plastic or glass jar water, milk, measuring spoons, flashlight a darkened room What to do: 
Fill the glass or jar about 2/3 full of water (about 8 - 12 oz. or 250 - 400 ml)
Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (2 - 5 ml) milk and stir.
Take the glass and flashlight into a darkened room.
Hold the flashlight above the surface of the water and observe the water in the glass from the side. It should have a slight bluish tint. Now, hold the flashlight to the side of the glass and look through the water directly at the light. The water should have a slightly reddish tint. Put the flashlight under the glass and look down into the water from the top. It should have a deeper reddish tint.
What happened: The small particles of milk suspended in the water scattered the light from the flashlight, like the dust particles and molecules in the air scatter sunlight. When the light shines in the top of the glass, the water looks blue because you see blue light scattered to the side. When you look through the water directly at the light, it appears red because some of the blue was removed by scattering. 



PROJECT 3 -Mixing colors

You need: 
a pencil, scissors, white cardboard or heavy white paper crayons or markers, a ruler a small bowl or a large cup (3 - 4 inch, or 7 - 10 cm diameter rim) a paper cup What to do: 
Use the bowl to trace a circle onto a piece of white cardboard and cut it out. With the ruler, divide it into six approximately equal sections.
Color the six sections with the colors of the spectrum as shown. Try to color as smoothly and evenly as possible.
Poke a hole through the middle of the circle and push the pencil part of the way through.
Poke a hole in the bottom of the paper cup, a little bit larger than the diameter of the pencil. Turn the cup upside down on a piece of paper, and put the pencil through so the point rests on the paper on a table. Adjust the color wheel's position on the pencil so that it is about 1/2 inch (1 - 2 cm) above the cup.
Spin the pencil quickly and observe the color wheel. Adjust as necessary so that the pencil and wheel spin easily.


 
What happened: The colors on the wheel are the main colors in white light. When the wheel spins fast enough, the colors all appear to blend together, and the wheel looks white. Try experimenting with different color combinations.

Argument From Spurious Linguistic Coincidence (ref: Zeitgeist on religion):

Jim: Pepsi is made of baby koalas.

Bob: No it's not! It's just Coke that's made from baby pandas.

Jim: We call it Pepsi "Cola" because it is supposedly includes an extract from the kola nut. But, seriously, people don't make drinks out of nuts! Ever seen drinkable peanut butter? Now, in the Hebrew language, vowels are not written, so "kola" would be spelled with a kaf and a lahmed, or k-l using English letters. Notice that "koala" would be spelled in the exact same way in Hebrew, k-l. So, Biblically and in terms of Qabbalistic gematria, the two words are equivalent. Now, "Pepsi" comes from a chemical called pepcin, which was originally an ingredient in Pepsi. Notice that the root word "pep-" is also a word for biological energy. So we can see that the "pep" in Pepsi comes from life energy. It is also the same root word found in "neuropeptide." Also, notice how the "si" in Pepsi means "yes" in Spanish. So "Pepsi Cola" is really a secret code for "Life energy? Yes! Koala!"

As you can see, Pepsi is made from the neuropeptides of koala bears.

Bob: >Twitches, then goes into coma<

Jim (thinking): Ah, revenge is sweet!

Disney XD Audio format Dolby Digital 5.1 Original run August 17, 2007 – present Chronology Related shows Take Two with Phineas and Ferb External links Official Website Phineas and Ferb is an American animated television comedy series. Originally broadcast as a preview on August 17, 2007, on Disney Channel, the series follows Phineas Flynn and his English stepbrother Ferb Fletcher[1] on summer vacation. Every day the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who tries to bust them. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the B-Plot almost always features Perry the Platypus ("Agent P"), acting as a secret agent to fight an evil scientist named Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.
Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh worked together on the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life. The Creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters: Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Phineas and Ferb was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy—the blueprint for the eponymous Phineas—in a restaurant. Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched to networks for 16 years before securing a run on Disney Channel.[1]
The series is also known for its musical numbers, which have appeared in almost every episode since the first-season "Flop Starz". Disney's managers particularly enjoyed the episode's song, "Gitchee, Gitchee Goo", and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode.[2] The show's creators write and record each number, and vary musical tempo depending on each song's dramatic use.[3] The music has earned the series a total of four Emmy nominations: in 2008 for the main title theme and for the song "I Ain't Got Rhythm" from the episode "Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together",[4] and then in 2010 for the song "Come Home Perry" from the episode "Oh, There You Are, Perry" as well as one for its score. The series has also been popular with adults.[5][6][7] Phineas and Ferb is currently on its third season



The show follows the adventures of stepbrothers Phineas Flynn (Vincent Martella) and Ferb Fletcher (Thomas Sangster), who live in the fictional town of Danville, somewhere in the Tri-State area. Their older sister, Candace Flynn (Ashley Tisdale), is obsessed with two things throughout the show. One is "busting" Phineas and Ferb's schemes and ideas, usually calling their mother to report the boys' activities in an attempt to get them in trouble, but is never successful because of events that transpire in another subplot. Second she is somewhat obsessed with her now boyfriend Jeremy. [2] Meanwhile, the boys' pet platypus, Perry, acts as a secret agent for an all-animal government organization[10][11] called the O.W.C.A. ("Organization Without a Cool Acronym"), fighting Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.[12]
Much of the series' humor relies on running gags used in every episode with slight variation.[13] For example, several episodes feature an adult asking Phineas if he is too young to be performing some complex activity, to which he responds "Yes, yes I am." Also, Phineas and Ferb, along with other characters, before starting their inventions, ask, "Hey, where's Perry?".[1] Perry and Doofenshmirtz's confrontations generally lead to the destruction or disappearance of whatever Phineas and Ferb are constructing or taking part in that day.[12][13]
Aspects of the show's humor are aimed at adults,[14] including its frequent pop-cultural references.[15] Co-creator Dan Povenmire, sought to create a show that was less raunchy than Family Guy—having previously worked on the show—but had the same reliance on comic timing, employing humorous blank stares, expressionless faces and wordplay.[16] Povenmire describes the show as a combination of Family Guy and SpongeBob SquarePants.[17] Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, the other co-creator, said the show was not created just for kids, but simply did not exclude them as an audience.[14]

Characters 

Main article: List of Phineas and Ferb characters
    
A platypus was included in the series due to its interesting appearance.[18]


The series' main characters live in a blended family, a premise the creators considered underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's all we need to know."[19] The choice of a platypus as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit its striking appearance.[18] The platypus also gives them freedom to "make stuff up" since "no one knows very much about [them]."[19]
Marsh called the characters "cool, edgy and clever without [...] being mean-spirited." According to Povenmire, their animation director, Rob Hughes, agreed: "in all the other shows every character is either stupid or a jerk, but there are no stupid characters or jerks in this one."[2]
Music 

Main article: List of Phineas and Ferb songs
"Every episode since [Flop Starz] has a song in it. It's not always the characters singing onscreen — they don't break into song just to advance the plot. The music doesn't come out of nowhere, sometimes it's just a montage over action. We've done every genre known to man: ABBA, Broadway show tunes, 16th-century madrigals"

​
Dan Povenmire on the songs.[2]​

Phineas and Ferb follows structural conventions Povenmire and Marsh developed while writing Rocko's Modern Life, whereby each episode features "a song or a musical number, plus a big action/chase scene".[2] Both creators had musical backgrounds, as Povenmire performed rock'n'roll in his college years[20] and Marsh's grandfather was the bandleader Les Brown.[14]
The creators' original pitch to Disney emphasized Perry's signature "secret agent theme" and the song "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" from the episode "Flop Starz". Disney's managers enjoyed the songs and asked Povenmire and Marsh to write one for each episode.[2]
The songs span many genres, from 16th-century madrigals to Broadway show tunes.[2] Each is written in an intensive session during episode production: a concept, score, and lyrics are developed quite quickly.[3] Together, Marsh and Povenmire can "write a song about almost anything" and in only one hour at most.[19] After they finish writing the song, Povenmire and Marsh sing it over the answering machine of series composer Danny Jacob on Friday nights. By the following Monday the song is fully produced.[21]
The title sequence music, originally named 'Today is Going to be a Great Day' and performed by the American band Bowling for Soup,[12] was nominated for an Emmy award in 2008.[4] The creators originally wrote a slower number, more like a "classic Disney song", but the network felt changes were needed to appeal to modern children and commissioned a rock/ska version which made the final cut.[9]
A season 2 clip show broadcast in October 2009 focused on the music of Phineas and Ferb, featuring a viewer-voted top-10 of songs from the series; the end result was the "Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown."[22]
Origins 

    
Phineas and Ferb co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh in 2009.


Early inspirations 

Co-creator Dan Povenmire attributes the show's genesis to growing up in Mobile, Alabama, where his mother told him never to waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, "My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera."[1][9][23] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.[20] Meanwhile, Marsh grew up in a large, blended family.[14] As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun.[2]
Conception 

    
Drawn on butcher paper, this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of characters and the outline of the artistic style.[2]

What is a rainbow?

Author Donald Ahrens in his text Meteorology Today describes a rainbow as "one of the most spectacular light shows observed on earth". Indeed the traditional rainbow is sunlight spread out into its spectrum of colors and diverted to the eye of the observer by water droplets. The "bow" part of the word describes the fact that the rainbow is a group of nearly circular arcs of color all having a common center.
Where is the sun when you see a rainbow?

This is a good question to start thinking about the physical process that gives rise to a rainbow. Most people have never noticed that the sun is always behind you when you face a rainbow, and that the center of the circular arc of the rainbow is in the direction opposite to that of the sun. The rain, of course, is in the direction of the rainbow.
What makes the bow?

A question like this calls for a proper physical answer. We will discuss the formation of a rainbow by raindrops. It is a problem in optics that was first clearly discussed by Rene Descartes in 1637. An interesting historical account of this is to be found in Carl Boyer's book, The Rainbow From Myth to Mathematics. Descartes simplified the study of the rainbow by reducing it to a study of one water droplet and how it interacts with light falling upon it.
He writes:"Considering that this bow appears not only in the sky, but also in the air near us, whenever there are drops of water illuminated by the sun, as we can see in certain fountains, I readily decided that it arose only from the way in which the rays of light act on these drops and pass from them to our eyes. Further, knowing that the drops are round, as has been formerly proved, and seeing that whether they are larger or smaller, the appearance of the bow is not changed in any way, I had the idea of making a very large one, so that I could examine it better.

Descarte describes how he held up a large sphere in the sunlight and looked at the sunlight reflected in it. He wrote "I found that if the sunlight came, for example, from the part of the sky which is marked AFZ 

and my eye was at the point E, when I put the globe in position BCD, its part D appeared all red, and much more brilliant than the rest of it; and that whether I approached it or receded from it, or put it on my right or my left, or even turned it round about my head, provided that the line DE always made an angle of about forty-two degrees with the line EM, which we are to think of as drawn from the center of the sun to the eye, the part D appeared always similarly red; but that as soon as I made this angle DEM even a little larger, the red color disappeared; and if I made the angle a little smaller, the color did not disappear all at once, but divided itself first as if into two parts, less brilliant, and in which I could see yellow, blue, and other colors ... When I examined more particularly, in the globe BCD, what it was which made the part D appear red, I found that it was the rays of the sun which, coming from A to B, bend on entering the water at the point B, and to pass to C, where they are reflected to D, and bending there again as they pass out of the water, proceed to the point ".

This quotation illustrates how the shape of the rainbow is explained. To simplify the analysis, consider the path of a ray of monochromatic light through a single spherical raindrop. Imagine how light is refracted as it enters the raindrop, then how it is reflected by the internal, curved, mirror-like surface of the raindrop, and finally how it is refracted as it emerges from the drop. If we then apply the results for a single raindrop to a whole collection of raindrops in the sky, we can visualize the shape of the bow.

The traditional diagram to illustrate this is shown here as adapted from Humphreys, Physics of the Air. It represents the path of one light ray incident on a water droplet from the direction SA. As the light beam enters the surface of the drop at A, it is bent (refracted) a little and strikes the inside wall of the drop at B, where it is reflected back to C. As it emerges from the drop it is refracted (bent) again into the direction CE. The angle D represents a measure of the deviation of the emergent ray from its original direction. Descartes calculated this deviation for a ray of red light to be about 180 - 42 or 138 degrees.

The ray drawn here is significant because it represents the ray that has the smallest angle of deviation of all the rays incident upon the raindrop. It is called the Descarte or rainbow ray and much of the sunlight as it is refracted and reflected through the raindrop is focused along this ray. Thus the reflected light is diffuse and weaker except near the direction of this rainbow ray. It is this concentration of rays near the minimum deviation that gives rise to the arc of rainbow.

The sun is so far away that we can, to a good approximation, assume that sunlight can be represented by a set of parallel rays all falling on the water globule and being refracted, reflected internally, and refracted again on emergence from the droplet in a manner like the figure. Descartes writes

I took my pen and made an accurate calculation of the paths of the rays which fall on the different points of a globe of water to determine at which angles, after two refractions and one or two reflections they will come to the eye, and I then found that after one reflection and two refractions there are many more rays which can be seen at an angle of from forty-one to forty-two degrees than at any smaller angle; and that there are none which can be seen at a larger angle" (the angle he is referring to is 180 - D).

A typical raindrop is spherical and therefore its effect on sunlight is symmetrical about an axis through the center of the drop and the source of light (in this case the sun). Because of this symmetry, the two-dimensional illustration of the figure serves us well and the complete picture can be visualized by rotating the two dimensional illustration about the axis of symmetry. The symmetry of the focusing effect of each drop is such that whenever we view a raindrop along the line of sight defined by the rainbow ray, we will see a bright spot of reflected/refracted sunlight. Referring to the figure, we see that the rainbow ray for red light makes an angle of 42 degrees between the direction of the incident sunlight and the line of sight. Therefore, as long as the raindrop is viewed along a line of sight that makes this angle with the direction of incident light, we will see a brightening. The rainbow is thus a circle of angular radius 42 degrees, centered on the antisolar point, as shown schematically here.

We don't see a full circle because the earth gets in the way. The lower the sun is to the horizon, the more of the circle we see -right at sunset, we would see a full semicircle of the rainbow with the top of the arch 42 degrees above the horizon. The higher the sun is in the sky, the smaller is the arch of the rainbow above the horizon.

What makes the colors in the rainbow?

The traditional description of the rainbow is that it is made up of seven colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Actually, the rainbow is a whole continuum of colors from red to violet and even beyond the colors that the eye can see.
The colors of the rainbow arise from two basic facts:

Sunlight is made up of the whole range of colors that the eye can detect. The range of sunlight colors, when combined, looks white to the eye. This property of sunlight was first demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666.
Light of different colors is refracted by different amounts when it passes from one medium (air, for example) into another (water or glass, for example).
Descartes and Willebrord Snell had determined how a ray of light is bent, or refracted, as it traverses regions of different densities, such as air and water. When the light paths through a raindrop are traced for red and blue light, one finds that the angle of deviation is different for the two colors because blue light is bent or refracted more than is the red light. This implies that when we see a rainbow and its band of colors we are looking at light refracted and reflected from different raindrops, some viewed at an angle of 42 degrees; some, at an angle of 40 degrees, and some in between. This is illustrated in this drawing, adapted from Johnson's Physical Meteorology. This rainbow of two colors would have a width of almost 2 degrees (about four times larger than the angular size as the full moon). Note that even though blue light is refracted more than red light in a single drop, we see the blue light on the inner part of the arc because we are looking along a different line of sight that has a smaller angle (40 degrees) for the blue.
Ana excellent laboratory exercise on the mathematics of rainbows is here, and F. K. Hwang has produced a fine Java Applet illustrating this refraction, and Nigel Greenwood has written a program that operates in MS Excel that illustrates the way the angles change as a function of the sun's angle.

What makes a double rainbow?

Sometimes we see two rainbows at once, what causes this? We have followed the path of a ray of sunlight as it enters and is reflected inside the raindrop. But not all of the energy of the ray escapes the raindrop after it is reflected once. A part of the ray is reflected again and travels along inside the drop to emerge from the drop. The rainbow we normally see is called the primary rainbow and is produced by one internal reflection; the secondary rainbow arises from two internal reflections and the rays exit the drop at an angle of 50 degrees° rather than the 42°degrees for the red primary bow. Blue light emerges at an even larger angle of 53 degrees°. his effect produces a secondary rainbow that has its colors reversed compared to the primary, as illustrated in the drawing, adapted from the Science Universe Series Sight, Light, and Color.
It is possible for light to be reflected more than twice within a raindrop, and one can calculate where the higher order rainbows might be seen; but these are never seen in normal circumstances.

Why is the sky brighter inside a rainbow?

Notice the contrast between the sky inside the arc and outside it. When one studies the refraction of sunlight on a raindrop one finds that there are many rays emerging at angles smaller than the rainbow ray, but essentially no light from single internal reflections at angles greater than this ray. Thus there is a lot of light within the bow, and very little beyond it. Because this light is a mix of all the rainbow colors, it is white. In the case of the secondary rainbow, the rainbow ray is the smallest angle and there are many rays emerging at angles greater than this one. Therefore the two bows combine to define a dark region between them - called Alexander's Dark Band, in honor of Alexander of Aphrodisias who discussed it some 1800 years ago!
What are Supernumerary Arcs?

In some rainbows, faint arcs just inside and near the top of the primary bow can be seen. These are called supernumerary arcs and were explained by Thomas Young in 1804 as arising from the interference of light along certain rays within the drop. Young's work had a profound influence on theories of the physical nature of light and his studies of the rainbow were a fundamental element of this. Young interpreted light in terms of it being a wave of some sort and that when two rays are scattered in the same direction within a raindrop, they may interfere with each other. Depending on how the rays mesh together, the interference can be constructive, in which case the rays produce a brightening, or destructive, in which case there is a reduction in brightness. This phenomenon is clearly described in Nussenzveig's article "The Theory of the Rainbow" in which he writes: "At angles very close to the rainbow angle the two paths through the droplet differ only slightly, and so the two rays interfere constructively. As the angle increases, the two rays follow paths of substantially different lengths. When the difference equals half of the wavelength, the interference is completely destructive; at still greater angles the beams reinforce again. The result is a periodic variation in the intensity of the scattered light, a series of alternately bright and dark bands."
Mikolaj and Pawel Sawicki have posted several beautiful photographs of rainbows showing these arcs.

The "purity" of the colors of the rainbow depends on the size of the raindrops. Large drops (diameters of a few millimeters) give bright rainbows with well defined colors; small droplets (diameters of about 0.01 mm) produce rainbows of overlapping colors that appear nearly white. And remember that the models that predict a rainbow arc all assume spherical shapes for raindrops.

There is never a single size for water drops in rain but a mixture of many sizes and shapes. This results in a composite rainbow. Raindrops generally don't "grow" to radii larger than about 0.5 cm without breaking up because of collisions with other raindrops, although occasionally drops a few millimeters larger in radius have been observed when there are very few drops (and so few collisions between the drops) in a rainstorm. Bill Livingston suggests: " If you are brave enough, look up during a thunder shower at the falling drops. Some may hit your eye (or glasses), but this is not fatal. You will actually see that the drops are distorted and are oscillating."

It is the surface tension of water that moulds raindrops into spherical shapes, if no other forces are acting on them. But as a drop falls in the air, the 'drag' causes a distortion in its shape, making it somewhat flattened. Deviations from a spherical shape have been measured by suspending drops in the air stream of a vertical wind tunnel (Pruppacher and Beard, 1970, and Pruppacher and Pitter, 1971). Small drops of radius less than 140 microns (0.014 cm) remain spherical, but as the size of the drop increases, the flattening becomes noticeable. For drops with a radius near 0.14 cm, the height/width ratio is 0.85. This flattening increases for larger drops.

Spherical drops produce symmetrical rainbows, but rainbows seen when the sun is near the horizon are often observed to be brighter at their sides, the vertical part, than at their top. Alistair Fraser has explained this phenomenon as resulting from the complex mixture of size and shape of the raindrops. The reflection and refraction of light from a flattened water droplet is not symmetrical. For a flattened drop, some of the rainbow ray is lost at top and bottom of the drop. Therefore, we see the rays from these flattened drops only as we view them horizontally; thus the rainbow produced by the large drops is is bright at its base. Near the top of the arc only small spherical drops produce the fainter rainbow.

What does a rainbow look like through dark glasses?

This is a "trick" question because the answer depends on whether or not your glasses are Polaroid. When light is reflected at certain angles it becomes polarized (discussed again quite well in Nussenzveig's article), and it has been found that the rainbow angle is close to that angle of reflection at which incident, unpolarized light (sunlight) is almost completely polarized. So if you look at a rainbow with Polaroid sunglasses and rotate the lenses around the line of sight, part of the rainbow will disappear!
Other Questions about the Rainbow

Humphreys (Physics of the Air, p. 478) discusses several "popular" questions about the rainbow:
"What is the rainbow's distance?" It is nearby or far away, according to where the raindrops are, extending from the closest to the farthest illuminated drops along the elements of the rainbow cone.
Why is the rainbow so frequently seen during summer and so seldom during winter?" To see a rainbow, one has to have rain and sunshine. In the winter, water droplets freeze into ice particles that do not produce a rainbow but scatter light in other very interesting patterns.
"Why are rainbows so rarely seen at noon?" Remember that the center of the rainbow's circle is opposite the sun so that it is as far below the level of the observer as the sun is above it.
"Do two people ever see the same rainbow?" Humphreys points out that "since the rainbow is a special distribution of colors (produced in a particular way) with reference to a definite point - the eye of the observer - and as no single distribution can be the same for two separate points, it follows that two observers do not, and cannot, see the same rainbow." In fact, each eye sees its own rainbow!! 
Of course, a camera lens will record an image of a rainbow which can then be seen my many people! (thanks to Tom and Rachel Ludovise for pointing this out!)
"Can the same rainbow be seen by reflection as seen directly?" On the basis of the arguments given in the preceding question, bows appropriate for two different points are produced by different drops; hence, a bow seen by reflection is not the same as the one seen directly".
What are Reflection Rainbows?

A reflection rainbow is defined as one produced by the reflection of the source of incident light (usually the sun). Photographs of them are perhaps the most impressive of rainbow photographs. The reflected rainbow may be considered as a combination of two rainbows produced by sunlight coming from two different directions - one directly from the sun, the other from the reflected image of the sun. The angles are quite different and therefore the elevation of the rainbow arcs will be correspondingly different. This is illustrated in a diagram adapted from Greenler"s Rainbows, Halos, and Glories. The rainbow produced by sunlight reflected from the water is higher in the sky than is the one produced by direct sunlight.
What is a Lunar Rainbow?

A full moon is bright enough to have its light refracted by raindrops just as is the case for the sun. Moonlight is much fainter, of course, so the lunar rainbow is not nearly as bright as one produced by sunlight. Lunar rainbows have infrequently been observed since the time of Aristotle or before. A graphic description of one was writen by Dr. Mikkelson.
Rainbows and Proverbs

There is a delightful book by Humphreys entitled Weather Proverbs and Paradoxes. In it, he discusses the meteorological justifications of some proverbs associated with rainbows, such as "Rainbow at night, shepherd's delight;Rainbow in morning, shepherds take warning,"If there be a rainbow in the eve,It will rain and leave; But if there be a rainbow in the morrow It will neither lend nor borrow", and Rainbow to windward, foul fall the day; Rainbow to leeward, damp runs away."
The meteorological discussion Humphreys presents is appropriate for the northern temperate zones that have a prevailing wind, and also for a normal diurnal change in the weather.

Experiments

William Livingston, a solar astronomer who has also specialized in atmospheric optical phenomena suggests the following: "Try a hose spray yourself. As you produce a fine spray supernumeraries up to order three become nicely visible. "Try to estimate the size of these drops compared to a raindrop. ..."Another thing to try. View a water droplet on a leaf close-up - an inch from your eye. At the rainbow angle you may catch a nice bit of color!"
In Minnaert's excellent book Light and Colour in the Open Air you can find a number of experiments on how to study the nature of rainbows. Here is an illustration of one of his suggestions. Other demonstration projects are listed here .

Bosse 1
A Logical Analysis - John 6:44
By Brian Bosse
Bosse 2
A debate between two theological positions has raged. Arminianism, which questioned the doctrines of the Dutch Reformed Church in the late 16th – early 17th centuries, insisted upon fallen man&#8223;s ability to choose God apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. The Dutch Reformed Church, which embraced the theology of Calvinism, responded by re-affirming that man is in such bondage to sin that apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit he would never choose God. The Biblical passage of John 6:44 was at the heart of this issue, especially the nature of God&#8223;s drawing. Arminians believe that God&#8223;s drawing of people to Himself is universal, yet is not effectual. That is to say, even though God draws all people, they do not necessarily come. God&#8223;s drawing is seen as an invitation that can be accepted or refused independently of God. Calvinists, on the other hand, believe that God draws only the elect, this drawing is part of the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, and it is effectual. That is to say, God&#8223;s drawing is irresistible so that everyone who is drawn necessarily comes.
This paper is a logical analysis of John 6:44 followed by the implications for both the traditional Arminian and Calvinist positions. It is divided into four sections. Section one will deal with the Greek text and translation; section two will be a logical analysis of the text – ending with John 6:44 expressed in semi-formal terms; section three will explore the consequences of the logical analysis regarding Arminianism and Calvinism; and section four will be the conclusion. The conclusion reached is that under Arminian assumptions one is left with universalism; whereas, under Calvinist assumptions, Calvinism is found to be consistent.

Section One – The Greek Text
John 6:44 (UBS): 
ouvdei.j du,natai evlqei/n pro,j me eva.n mh. o` path.r o` pe,myaj me e`lku,sh| auvto,n( kai. evgw. avnasth,sw auvto.n [evn] th/| evsca,th| h`me,ra|Å1​

​
Any translation of an ancient language begins with the verbs. It should be noted that there are five verbs in the verse: du,natai, evlqei/n, pe,myaj, e`lku,sh, and avnasth,sw.
Du,natai
Du,natai 
is the 3rd person singular deponent2 indicative form of du,namai. A deponent verb is one that has a middle/passive voice form but is active in meaning.3 The translation of this verb would be “he, she, or it is able,” speaking of ability. Most translations use the word „can,&#8223;4 which certainly captures this meaning, especially if the „can&#8223; versus „may&#8223; distinction is kept in mind. However, to avoid possible confusion, the more explicit „able&#8223; will be used to indicate that ability is what is being communicated. Please note for future reference that this verb is a present tense verb.

Kurt Aland, Et al., The Greek New Testament – Fourth Revised Edition, published by the United Bible Societies, © 2001 (UBS). There are two minor textual variants in the passage. a, P 75, and the Textus Receptus omit the evn, and some manuscripts have kavgw. – a crasis of kai. evgw. – instead of kai. evgw. . A crasis occurs when two words are “pushed together” to make one. In this case, kai. evgw. has been pushed together to form kavgw. They both carry the meaning of “and I.” These variants do not affect the analysis.​

Richard A. Young, Intermediate New Testament Greek – A Linguistic and Exegetical Approach, Broadman and Homan, Nashville, TN, ©1994, pg. 135. The term „deponent&#8223; comes from the Latin „deponere&#8223; – meaning “to put down.” The idea is that these verbs “put down” their active forms.​

Elqei/n
Elqei/n 
is the second aorist active infinitive of e;rcomai. It is considered a complimentary infinitive, and is acting as an adverb modifying the verb du,natai. This is simply translated as “to come.” 5​

​
​
Pe,myaj
Pe,myaj 
is the aorist active nominative masculine singular participle of the verb pe,mpw, and is acting in the second attributive position modifying the noun path.r. This can be translated as “having sent.”​

Elku,sh
Elku,sh 
is the subjunctive aorist active 3rd person singular of e[lkw. Most translators translate this verb as “draws.” Please note that e`lku,sh is in the subjunctive mood.​

Anasth,sw
Anasth,sw 
is the future active indicative 1st person singular of avni,sthmi. It can be translated as “I will raise up.”​

​
Bosse 5
At this point, there is one other word we need to consider before presenting the translation – the subordinate conjunction eva.n, which indicates the protasis6 of a conditional sentence. That is to say, the eva.n found in John 6:44 marks the beginning of an “if…then…” conditional statement.​

In the Greek language there are distinctions made regarding the semantic categories of conditional sentences. In Daniel Wallace&#8223;s Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics he lists the eva.n found in John 6:44 under the category of 3rd Class Conditionals.7 Regarding 3rd class conditionals, Mounce states in Basics of Greek Grammar, “Third class conditional sentences always have a protasis introduced by eva.n and a verb in the subjunctive. The verb in the apodosis8 can be any tense or mood.”9 As noted above, e`lku,sh is a subjunctive verb, and is the subjunctive verb in the protasis of our conditional statement.
There are two subdivisions of 3rd class conditionals: future more probable and present general. For a conditional to be the present general case the verb in the apodosis must be in the present tense.10 As we noted above du,natai, the verb in the apodosis, is a present tense verb. Our conditional fits the form of a present general conditional, and the
6 
The protasis of a conditional sentence is the antecedent of the conditional sentence. Consider the following conditional sentence: If you believe, then you will be saved. “You believe” is the protasis (antecedent) of the conditional.​

​

Wallace, pg. 699.​

​
8 
The apodosis of a conditional sentence is the consequent of the conditional sentence. Consider the following conditional sentence: If you believe, then you will be saved. “You will be saved” is the apodosis (consequent) of the conditional.​

​

Mounce, p. 288.​

​
Bosse 6
context points to this. Present general conditionals state “a general truth, an axiomatic truth.”11 Therefore, what is being communicated in verse 44 of John 6 is an axiomatic truth regarding man&#8223;s ability/inability to come to Jesus. The passage is now able to be translated.
Translation: (A) 
No one is able to come to Me (B) if not the Father – the One having sent Me – draws him, (C) and I will raise him up on the last day.
At first blush, many will notice that section B is translated differently than what is commonly found in most translations. Section B is the protasis of the 3rd class present general conditional.12 As such, the above translation is a very literal translation capturing the full force of the conditional. In English, this translation is a little awkward, and consequently, the other translations attempt to smooth it out. Suffice it to say, the translation presented is very faithful to the text, even though it may read a bit rough. Please note that the apodosis of the conditional is section A. The apodosis preceding the protasis is a little unusual, but it certainly is not unheard of. This is exactly what the grammar of the sentence dictates.
11 
Ibid., p. 288.​

​

Wallace calls this type of conditional a 5th class conditional rather than distinguishing between two types of 3rd class conditionals as does Mounce.​

Bosse 7
Section Two – A Logical Analysis
The verse is grammatically set up into three sections labeled A, B, and C as
indicated the above translation. What will be determined is the logical relationship
between these three sections. To help with the logical analysis the three sections will be
put into a semi-formal form, which will require a little revision of the translation.
Original: (A) 
No one is able to come to Me...
Revised: (A1) 
He is not able to come to Me…​

A1 does not change the meaning of our verse. &#8220;No one is able&#8221; has been
converted into &#8220;he is not able.&#8221; Someone might balk at this in that &#8220;no one&#8221; is more
general than &#8220;he,&#8221; but in terms of the passage with the Father drawing &#8220;him&#8221; and Jesus
raising &#8220;him,&#8221; changing the &#8220;one&#8221; to match these pronouns does not change the meaning
of the verse. If q represents &#8220;he is able to come to Me,&#8221; then A1 is represented
symbolically by: q .13 Now we will turn our attention to section B.​
Original: (B) ​
&#8230;not the Father draws him&#8230;14​

Revised: (B1) ​
&#8230;the Father does not draw him&#8230;​
13 ​
​
The symbol &#8222; &#8223; designates the negation of what follows. The negation of &#8220;he is able&#8221; is &#8220;he is not
able.&#8221;​

14 ​
​
The phrase &#8220;&#8230;the One who sent Me&#8230;&#8221; has been purposefully left out. It modifies the Father (o` path.r),
and will not matter in terms of the logical analysis. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity and clarity it has​

been left out. Also, the &#8222;if&#8223; has been left out for the moment because conditional statements in logic h​
​
ave​

their own symbol to designate the &#8222;if.&#8223; This symbol will be used once we are ready to bring the 3 sections​
together.​
Bosse 8
If p represents &#8220;the Father does draw him,&#8221; then B1 is logically equivalent to p. Our
last section can be represented as follows&#8230;​

Original: (C) ​
&#8230; I will raise him up on the last day.15​

If r represents &#8220;I will raise him up on the last day,&#8221; then C is logically equivalent to r.
Pulling all of this together, we may now symbolically represent John 6:44 as follows&#8230;​

Revised John 6:44: ​
q if p and r.
The revised version of John 6:44 above reads, &#8220;He is not able to come to Me, if
the Father does not draw him, and I will raise him up on the last day.&#8221; The next step is to
represent &#8222;if&#8223; and &#8222;and&#8223; more formally. However, an interesting issue arises. As seen
from the grammatical discussion above regarding eva.n with the subjunctive, the
relationship between sections A and B has been defined. Section A is the apodosis, and
section B is the protasis of a conditional statement. In terms of symbolic logic this would
be stated the following way: p &#8594; q.16 This would read, &#8220;If the Father does not draw
him, then he is not able to come to me,&#8221; and carries the same meaning as does the
original verse. The issue that faces us is how the &#8220;and r&#8221; relates to the conditional
sentence. Is &#8222;r&#8223; part of the protasis, and if so, does mh. (not) negate both &#8222;p&#8223; and &#8222;r&#8223;, or​
15 ​
​
The &#8222;and&#8223; of section 3 has been purposefully left out because it is uniquely represented in symbolic logic,​

and will be used when we bring the 3 sections together.​
16 ​
​
The symbol &#8222;&#8594;&#8223;indicates implication in logic. An implication is simply an &#8220;if&#8230;then&#8230;&#8221; conditional​

statement. Therefore, ​
​
p &#8594; q would read, &#8220;If p, then q.&#8221;​

Bosse 9
just the &#8222;p&#8223;? Is &#8222;r&#8223; part of the apodosis in our conditional sentence? Or, is &#8222;r&#8223; simply an
additional proposition following our conditional statement? In other words, there are
four possible relationships &#8222;r&#8223; might have with &#8222;p&#8223;and &#8222;q&#8223;:​
(1) ​
p r q 17​

(2) ​
p r q​

(3) ​
p q r​

(4) ​
p q r​

Possibility One: ​
p r q​

This sentence reads, &#8220;It is not the case that if [the Father draws him, and I will
raise him up on the last day]18, then he is not able to come to me.&#8221; By the logical law of​

contraposition p r q ​
is logically equivalent to q p r .19 This is logically
equivalent to q p q r , which says, &#8220;If you are able to come to Me, then the
Father draws you, and if you are able to come to Me, then I, [Jesus], will raise you up on
the last day.&#8221; These ideas are theologically interesting, but there are some grammatical
arguments against this reading.​
17 ​
​
The logical symbol &#8222; &#8223; indicates a conjunction, i.e., &#8222;and.&#8223;​

18 ​
​
Brackets will be used to make explicit the meaning of the formal statement when translated back into
English. In this particular instance, the brackets make explicit that ( p r ) represent the protasis of the
conditional.​

19 ​
​
The logical law of contraposition simply states that p &#8594; q is logically equivalent to q &#8594; p. This is​

intuitively obvious as the following will illustrate: &#8220;If you believe (​
​
p), then you will be saved (q)&#8221; is
logically equivalent to &#8220;if you are not saved ( q), then you did not believe ( p).&#8221;​

Bosse 10
Because the text is a 3rd class conditional, if possibility one were the case, then
both verbs in our protasis would need to be in the subjunctive mood, and the verb in our​
apodosis ​
would need to be in the past tense. In other words, the reading would be, &#8220;It is
not the case that if [the Father draws him (subjunctive) and I raise him up on the last day
(subjunctive)], then he was not able to come to Me (past tense).&#8221; However, the verb​

avnasth,sw​
is in the indicative and not subjunctive mood, and the verb du,namai is in the
present and not past tense. Therefore, possibility one is ruled out.​

Possibility Two:​
​
p r q​

This is very similar to possibility one, but logically it carries a different meaning.​
It reads, &#8220;If​
[the father does not draw him, and I will raise him up], then he is not able to​

come to Me.&#8221;​
There are theological and philosophical issues with this statement.
Assuming this condition is possible to be fulfilled, then there are three things being
stated: (1) Jesus raises up some who are not drawn by the Father; (2) those whom the
Father has not drawn, but Jesus raises up are not able to come to Jesus; and (3) not being
able to come to Jesus is dependent upon the future action of Jesus raising this person.
Regarding (1), both Arminians and Calvinists would agree this is inconsistent with the
context of the passage. (2) The raising up on the last day is a rising up to eternal life as
the context indicates &#8211; see John 6:40; 47. Both Arminians and Calvinists would deny that
there are some who are raised on the last day that did not come to Jesus. (3)
Philosophically, it is problematic to have the consequence of a person not being able to
Bosse 11
come to Jesus occur as a result of the future event of Jesus raising that person up on the
last day. All of these problems render this formalization very unlikely. However, not
even considering the theological and philosophical issues raised, this statement is
precluded for the very same grammatical reasons possibility one was precluded.​

Possibility Three:​
​
p q r​

The rendering of this statement is as follows:​
&#8220;If the Father does not draw him,​

then​
[he is not able to come to Me, and I will raise him up].&#8221; This is logically equivalent​

to:​
p q p r , which reads, &#8220;If the father does not draw him, then he is not​

able to come to Me,​
and if the Father does not draw him, then I will raise him up.&#8221; The
theological problem with this is the idea that Jesus will raise up someone who has not
been drawn by the Father. As argued above, the context indicates otherwise. However,
this is not the only reason this reading is able to be dismissed. The grammatical structure
of the sentence is such that it is very unlikely section C is part of the apodosis of our
conditional sentence. There is no parallel construction in the New Testament or
Septuagint where the conjunction of the apodosis is separated by the protasis. These
theological and grammatical issues dismiss this possibility leaving us with the most
natural rendering of the text: possibility four.
Bosse 12​

Possibility Four:​
​

Section Three​
[FONT=Times New Roman,Bold]&#8211; [/FONT]Theological Implications of the Analysis​

Having determined the logical structure of the passage, we now apply this to the
Arminian/Calvinist debate discussed earlier. The Arminian position is that God draws all
people,​
20 and as a result of this drawing all people are able to come to Jesus, but all do
not come to Jesus. How do these assumptions fit in with our analysis of John 6:44?
The Arminian position that &#8220;God draws all people, and therefore all people are
able to come&#8221; is compatible with John 6:44; however, based on our logical analysis
above, the consequence of this position is not consistent with the position that &#8220;all do not
come to Jesus.&#8221; It has already been established that John 6:44 is saying: q p r .​

​
​
Arminians will normally appeal to John 12:32 in support of this.​

Bosse 13
Applying the assump​
tion that &#8220;God draws all people, and therefore all people are able to come&#8221; to the verse we are left with the following:​

Premise 1: [​
​
If he is able to come to Me, then the Father drew him], and I will raise him up on the last day. (John 6:44)​

Premise 2:​
​
He (all people) is able to come to Me, and the Father draws him (all people).21 (Arminian Position)​

Conclusion:​
​
I (Jesus) will raise him (all people) up on the last day.
This is a very startling conclusion. If all people are able to come and are drawn (i.e., if every &#8222;him&#8223; is able to come and every &#8222;him&#8223; is drawn), then every person (i.e., every &#8222;him&#8223;) will be raised up on the last day. This is universalism. The Arminian will object by saying that Jesus only raises those who do come. That is to say, they want to understand the referent of &#8222;him&#8223; in section C as the one who actually comes. However, there is no mention of the one who actually comes in John 6:44. This verse only mentions those who are drawn, and those who are able to come. The &#8222;him&#8223; in section C either refers to the one drawn, or it refers to the one able to come. There is no referent for the one who actually comes. As such, given the Arminian position that &#8220;God draws all people, and therefore all people are able to come,&#8221; John 6:44 logically entails universalism.​

21​
​
​
​
Technically, this premise is not in the proper form for the conclusion to follow immediately. However, the proper form that allows the conclusion to follow immediately is logically entailed by the premise.​

Bosse 14
The Calvinist, as does the Arminian, believes that all those drawn have the ability to come. The Calvinist,​
contra the Arminian, also believes that all who are drawn will necessarily come and will be raised up on the last day. Regarding those drawn, the Calvinist believes that only the elect are drawn. How does the Calvinist position hold up in light of John 6:44?​

Premise 1: [​
​
If he is able to come to Me, then the Father drew him], and I will raise him up on the last day. (John 6:44)​

Premise 2:​
​
He (all the elect) is able to come to Me, and the Father drew him (all the elect).22 (Calvinist Position)​

Conclusion:​
​
I (Jesus) will raise all the elect up on the last day.
This conclusion is completely compatible with the Calvinist position. In a sense, the Father&#8223;s drawing is a universal drawing. It is a universal drawing of the elect. That is to say, all of the elect will be drawn. The universal affirmative conclusion that the Father draws all the elect, and that all the elect will all be raised up on the last day is articulated by Peter when he says, &#8220;The Lord is not slow about His promise&#8230;but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.&#8221;23​

See footnote 21.​

​
​
NASB &#8211; 2 Peter 3:9.​

Bosse 15​
Section Four​
[FONT=Times New Roman,Bold]&#8211; [/FONT]Conclusion​

Based on the aforementioned analysis, the position taken by Calvinism is consistent with the logical consequences of John 6:44. The traditional Arminian position, however, has been demonstrated to be inconsistent resulting in universalism. It is interesting to note, based on the logical analysis done above John 6:44 does teach some type of universalism. It either teaches the salvation of all the elect (Calvinism) or it teaches the salvation of all every person (universalism).

HAMLET: To be, or not to be--that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-- No more--and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprise of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now, The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered. 

HAMLET: O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wanned, Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing, For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant for my cause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha, 'swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should ha' fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murdered, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must like a whore unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A stallion! Fie upon't, foh! About, my brains. Hum -- I have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimed their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks. I'll tent him to the quick. If 'a do blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be a devil, and the devil hath power T' assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative than this. The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. 
Queen Gertrude

O Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.

O, speak to me no more; These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet!
Alas, he's mad!
Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
To whom do you speak this?
This the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
